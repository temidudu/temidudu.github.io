#Project 3: LOAN APPROVAL OR DENIAL: DATA MINING APPROACH
In this project, I explored and analyzed a loan dataset from the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) to predict whether a customer's loan should be approved or denied using different statistical models and selected the best model using a scoring model in SAS Enterprise Miner Workstation 14.3. This project was one of my projects with two other team members during my graduate studies.
